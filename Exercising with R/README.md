Experiencing R with Different Datasets
========================================================

***

### Description

In this directory, I have worked with different datasets and used R to do exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data.

I did the exercises in 3 categories:

- R with Single Variables
- R with Two Variables
- R with Multiple Variables

For each category, I have provided an .rmd and a .pdf format.

- You can download the .rmd format, open it in RStudio, and start executing the commands right away
- Or, you can open the .pdf file and see the data, plots and explanation without having to execute anything

All of these execirses are part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program - EDA course.

These are not the final project for the course, but the exercises I did throughout the course.
